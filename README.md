# Project-IV-Code
Code for my final report for my final year project.

Most code follows the examples given under the various function help examples provided in spBayes (or spNNGP), but of course adjusted to fit the desired models.

The file named `Spatial model.R' contains the code used for the models and plots in chapter 3 of my report. 
That is, the Gaussian and non-Gaussian cases of the spatial only models.

The file named `STrepmodels.R' (Spatio-Temporal MODELS for my REPort, as opposed to my poster) has the code for models from chapter 4.
That is, the continuous and discrete time extensions into the spatio-temporal modelling world.

The file named `DNNGP Case.R' has the code for my one spatial, one temporal dimension implementation of then NNGP model structure. 

The file named `MCMC Expl.R' has the code for the MCMC example in chapter 2.

The file named `DNNGP2Dx1D.R' has the fully original code for my (naive) implementation of DNNGP on a tiny synthetic data set.
This features in the appendix of my report.
